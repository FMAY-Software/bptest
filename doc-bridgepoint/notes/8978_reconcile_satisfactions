# Modify graphics reconciliation to reconcile satisfactions  
### xtUML Project Implementation Note

1. Abstract
-----------
Currently component references get automatically assigned, and interface references get formalized, but satisactions do not get created. This issue is raised to auto create satisfaction during import of a MASL model.  

2. Document References
----------------------
<a id="2.1"></a>2.2 [BridgePoint DEI #8978](https://support.onefact.net/issues/8978) 
Graphics reconciliation is not connecting the ball and cup in a satisfaction.  
<a id="2.2"></a>2.2 [BridgePoint DEI #8484](https://support.onefact.net/issues/8484) 
Update import to create satisfactions.

<a id="2.4"></a>2.4 [BridgePoint DEI #8977](https://support.onefact.net/issues/8977) 
Manual test for automatic satisfaction creation.  

3. Background
-------------
Issue [[2.2]](#2.2) was raised to cause satisfactions to be autocreated during MASL import. That
issue's work is complete as described in its implemetation note 
However, the graphics reconciliation associated with this task is not complete.
Without the graphics reconciliation the work associated with #8484 is worthless. In
fact, it leaves the model in a worse state than if satisfactions were never created
because the user can not connect the ball and cup.
This issue is raised to reconcile the graphics.
 

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 For each unsatisfied provision search the package for a matching 
requirement and create a satisfaction if a match is found.  
4.2 Create no more than 1 satisfaction per requirement and provision.  
4.3 The satisfaction shall be created in the package that that contains the 
{imported}provision/{imported}requirement being satisfied.  
4.4 The graphics associated with the satisfaction must be reconciled [[2.4]](#2.4).  

5. Work Required
----------------
5.1 Modify ImportHelper.java::resolveMASLproject() that was introduced with  
[[2.2]](#2.2) and follow the pattern provided to introduce functionality that
iterates over each marked package to create satisfactions as specified
by the requirements.  

5.2 Introduce OAL that creates the satisfactions  
5.2.1 Introduce ooaofooa::Functions::autoCreateSatisfactions  
Here is the pseudo-code:
```
find all provisions in the given package
find all imported provisions in the given package
find all requirements in the given package
find all imported requirments in the given package
for each provision
  if not satisfied yet
    for each requirement
      find a match to the provision by name
      if found 
        create satisfaction
      end if
    end for
  end if
  if not satisfied yet
    for each imported requirement
      find a match to the provision by name
      if found 
        create satisfaction
      end if
    end for
  end if
end for

repeat the above look with imported provisions

```  

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 During testing it was found that graphics reconciliation of satisfactions
is not working. The "ball and cup" are not being connected. This problem 
existed prior to this task, and is being handled by a separate issue 
[[2.4]](#2.4). However, this is a blocker for this task. The reason this is
a blocker is that once the satisfaction is created, if the graphics reconciliation
does not connect the "ball and cup". The user is left worse off then had auto satisfaction
never happend because they are unable to connect the ball and cup manually without first
unsatisfying the interface.  

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1 Run the manual test defined by [[2.3]](#2.3).  

8. User Documentation
---------------------
none
